Text Fighter is a text-based RPG game. It's still in early development (Alpha stage), so there may be a lot of bugs/missing features. There isn't really any set goal or missions yet, but there's still a lot of things you can do. Fight a variety of enemies to get coins, gain XP, and unlock achievements. You can spend money on more weapons/supplies, and unlock items by leveling up. There's even a casino where you can gamble your hard-earned coins. If you aren't one who likes playing by the rules, you can use the built-in cheats to your advantage (or disadvantage). More in-depth documentation/information is available via the in-game help menus.


This is my first (and currently only "big") Java project, so this is meant as a learning experience for me. I've been lightly developing this over the past couple of years while I learn Java. 

Contributing
-------------
I'm not actively developing this at the moment, but that doesn't mean the project is dead! Feel free to open PR's and I'll check them out! Whether you want to fix a small bug, or implement a new feature- all contributions are welcome and encouraged. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues) if you're looking for some stuff to do!

This project is very begginer friendly; I especially encourage new developers, or people learning java to contribute. I learned a lot developing this project, and hopefully you can learn from it as well! I'm always happy to give code-reviews or answer any questions; about the project, or about programming/java in general. Please don't hesitate to email me at `kalebmarc@hotmail.com`.


Installation
----------------
First, make sure you have the latest version of [Java](https://www.java.com) installed on your computer. Download the jar file from the latest [release](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/releases). 
Simply clicking on the .jar file won't work (..yet). You need to run it in the command line.
Open your command line/terminal, navigate to the downloaded .jar and run `java -jar Text-Fighter.jar`. If you want to run Text Fighter without the splash screen and popups (No GUI; true text-based), simply run it with the `nogui` option: `java -jar Text-Fighter.jar nogui`.
*Text-Fighter should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.*

Running
----------------
To run this project in IntelliJ use the [these configurations](https://imgur.com/a/IpXX3Jy)

Modifications
-------------------
I've made it easy to add your own weapons/enemy types into the game via modifying the code. With just a couple lines of code, you can fully implement a new weapon or enemy with your own properties. This will automatically setup achievements, and even create a full information page in the help menu for your modification. Instructions on how to do this can be found commented in-line at the bottom of [Start.java](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/blob/master/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Start.java)
 Feel free to fork your own copy, add your own enemies/weapons and then send a pull-request for me to add it to the code.

Documentation
---------------------
Pretty much all the information you need about the game mechanics is available in-game via the help menus (Accessible through the *home* menu). I'm not sure if I will add documentation about the code itself yet, that will be determined at a later time.

Upcoming
--------------
I'm planning to continue developing Text-Fighter for a while, as it's proven to be a good resource to help teach me Java. I don't have an end-goal for the project, but I do have a lot of things I want to eventually add. Everything I plan for Text Fighter is posted in [issues.](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues)


In the beta stage, I want to add a better UI while still keeping the game mostly text-based. For example, having buttons to click on instead of typing numbers in, but still having the output be in text form.

*If you want to request any feature, open an [issue](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues), and there's a good chance I'll add it.*
